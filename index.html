							<h1>Introduction</h1>

							<p>This website was created in order to present the work done during the Final Project of the course 02805 Social Graphs and Interactions at the Technical University of Denmark 
							The Final Project of the course consists of a network and datanalysis of a dataset chosen by the authors of this website. The chosen dataset was the Harry Potter "universe" which was created by from the text on the 
							Harry Potter Fandom Wikipedia site <a href="http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Main_Page">here</a>. The Fandom Wikipedia provides a fully structured copy of all their current pages structured into an XML file. The XML file can be downloaded from <a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/wikia_xml_dumps/h/ha/harrypotter_pages_current.xml.7z">here</a>.
							The network is constructed by finding a limited amount of characters and placing these as "nodes" in the network. Then by extracting the text from each characters Wikipedia website and from this identifying how many other nodes this character links to through its own page. If a link to another character is found then a "edge" (connection) between the two characters is created.
							By continously analyzing each character webpage a network is constructed and basic yet exciting question can be answered; who is the most connected character? Can we find communities between the characters? Which unique words identify each character?
							The project also contains other analyses like text mining and sentiment analysis of the books and movie scripts.
							The structure of the website is setup such that reading from the top to bottom provides a walkthrough of the different analyses performed on the network but the website contains no technical explanation of the procedures, this can be found in the <a href="google.com/insertIPythonNotebookHere">IPython Notebook</a></p>

							<h1>Network Analysis</h1>

							<p>The downloaded network can be visualized in different ways like seen below... (This should be rescaled to look nice @Jan)</p>

							<h2>Basic Statistics</h2>

							<p>The network consists of 1078 nodes, i.e. characters and include 5211 edges, i.e. connections. As seen from the pictures above we categorize each character into different categories which are; Gyffindors, Ravenclaws, Slytherins, Hufflepuffs, Muggles and Other Wizards,
							where the latter is a fairly large group of characters. These "communities" are what we will refer to as node attributes and further analysis of these communities will be carried out later.
							A fast an easy to calculate statistic is the degree distribution, which is basically found by counting the number of connections each node in the network has and then binning the degrees such that a distribution can be visualized. 
							Although first, let us just check the top nodes with respect to degree in the network as seen below.</p>
							<img src="img/degree_table.png" alt="Top 10 nodes sorted by degree">
							
							<p> Furthermore, in network analysis formally a connection can be categorized into either an in- or out-connection which is refered to as the in- and out-degree of a node. This exists as the graphs created are a type of graph refeered to as a directed graph meaning that the links between characters are directed, i.e. one character might link to another but the other character might not link to the first.
							Hence, by splitting the counts of degrees into in- and out-degrees the following two tables can be made: </p>
							<img src="img/in_degree_table.PNG", alt="Top 10 nodes sorted by in-degree">
							<img src="img/out_degree_table.PNG", alt="Top 10 nodes sorted by out-degree">
							
							<h2>Degree Distribution</h2>

							<p>From the above analysis of the node degrees, it is possible to visualize the complete degree distribution instead of just showing the top 10 nodes by binning the number of degrees and plotting this.
							Hence, below is the in- and out-degree distribution of the network where both linear axes and log-log axes are used to show the distribution. What is interesting about using the log-log axis is that the distributions approximately form a straight line with some slope meaning that the degree distributions follow a power law.
							This trait is very characteristic for social networks which have been investigated by researchers before and is a consequence of the fact that some nodes tend to have a very large degree and acting as hubs in the network and in this way creating the power law distribution.</p>
